# <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Findpapers Overview

## What is Findpapers?

**Findpapers** is a powerful Python application designed to help researchers conduct systematic literature searches across multiple academic databases simultaneously. It's specifically built for systematic reviews and metanalyses, automating many of the tedious tasks involved in literature discovery.

## The Findpapers Workflow

Findpapers follows a four-step process that aligns with systematic review best practices:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[1. SEARCH<br/>Multi-database query] --> B[2. REFINE<br/>Screen & categorize]
    B --> C[3. DOWNLOAD<br/>Get full-text PDFs]
    C --> D[4. BIBTEX<br/>Generate bibliography]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#e8f5e9
    style D fill:#f3e5f5
```

### 1. Search Command

Execute searches across multiple databases with a single command:

```bash
findpapers search results.json --query "[machine learning] AND [healthcare]"
```

### 2. Refine Command

Interactively screen, categorize, and select relevant papers:

```bash
findpapers refine results.json --abstract --extra-info
```

### 3. Download Command

Download full-text PDFs of selected papers:

```bash
findpapers download results.json ./papers/ --selected
```

### 4. BibTeX Command

Generate bibliography files:

```bash
findpapers bibtex results.json references.bib --selected
```

## Why Use Findpapers?

### Compared to Manual Searching

| Task | Manual Approach | Findpapers |
|------|----------------|------------|
| Search 5 databases | 2-3 hours | 5-10 minutes |
| Remove duplicates | 1-2 hours | Automatic |
| Track decisions | Spreadsheets | Built-in JSON |
| Download PDFs | One by one | Batch process |
| Generate BibTeX | Manual entry | One command |
| Reproducibility | Difficult | Fully documented |

## Programmatic Usage (Python API)

While Findpapers is primarily used through the command-line interface, it can also be used programmatically in Python scripts for advanced automation workflows.

````{dropdown} Click to see a minimal Python example
:color: primary
:icon: code

```python
from findpapers import search, refine

# Define your search query
query = "(machine learning OR deep learning) AND healthcare"

# Execute search across databases
search_result = search.run(
    query=query,
    since=2020,
    databases=['pubmed', 'arxiv', 'scopus'],
    filepath='results.json'
)

print(f"Found {len(search_result.papers)} papers")

# Programmatically refine results
for paper in search_result.papers:
    # Add your custom filtering logic
    if 'neural network' in paper.title.lower():
        paper.selected = True
        paper.categories.append('neural-networks')
    
    # Access paper metadata
    print(f"Title: {paper.title}")
    print(f"Authors: {', '.join(paper.authors)}")
    print(f"Year: {paper.publication_date}")
    print(f"DOI: {paper.doi}")

# Save refined results
search_result.save('results.json')

# Generate bibliography for selected papers
from findpapers import bibtex

bibtex.generate(
    filepath='results.json',
    output_filepath='references.bib',
    only_selected=True
)
```

**Key Objects:**

- `SearchResult`: Container for all papers and metadata
- `Paper`: Individual paper with title, authors, abstract, etc.
- `search.run()`: Execute search across databases
- `bibtex.generate()`: Create bibliography files

**Note**: For production workflows requiring more control, consider using [Research Buddy](../research_buddy/0_Overview) which provides a more robust Python API.
