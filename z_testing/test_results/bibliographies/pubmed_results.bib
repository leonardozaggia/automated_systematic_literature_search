  abstract = {This review presents a comprehensive overview of global optimization techniques applied to the prediction of chemical structures, including molecular conformations, crystal polymorphs, and reaction pathways. These approaches typically involve a two-step process: a global search to identify candidate structures, followed by local refinement to determine the most stable configurations. Global optimization methods are commonly grouped into two categories, known as stochastic and deterministic me...},

  abstract = {Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) promise to revolutionize computational chemistry; however, their performance depends critically on the quality and diversity of the training data. Existing quantum chemical datasets predominantly focus on equilibrium structures and exhibit limited halogen coverage, despite halogens being present in approximately 25% of pharmaceuticals and numerous materials. We present Halo8, a comprehensive dataset that addresses this gap by systematically inco...},
