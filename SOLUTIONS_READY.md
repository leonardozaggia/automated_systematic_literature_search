## üéØ FOR YOUR MEETING: Use This Approach

### Option 1: Quick Demo (5-8 minutes) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

```powershell
# Run the arXiv demo - everything works!
python quick_arxiv_demo.py
```

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Searches arXiv for AI + mental health papers
2. ‚úÖ Refines with categories (interactive)
3. ‚úÖ Downloads PDFs (all succeed!)
4. ‚úÖ Generates BibTeX with complete info

**Talking points:**
- "This uses arXiv, which provides open access to all papers"
- "In real systematic reviews, you'd search multiple databases"
- "arXiv is great for AI/ML papers - always downloadable"

### Option 2: Show The Problem AND Solution (10-12 minutes)

**Part A: Show existing PubMed results (2 min)**
```powershell
# Show the search results
cat mental_health_ai_demo/search_results.json | Select-String "title" | Select -First 5
```

**Part B: Explain why downloads failed (1 min)**
- "PubMed is metadata-only - doesn't provide PDF links"
- "Papers are in Journal of Affective Disorders - paywalled"

**Part C: Show the workaround (2 min)**
```powershell
# Generate access links
python extract_paper_links.py

# Open the CSV
paper_access_links.csv
```
- "We can access via Google Scholar and institutional library"

**Part D: Show what works (5 min)**
```powershell
# Run arXiv demo
python quick_arxiv_demo.py
```
- "This shows the complete workflow with open-access papers"

## üöÄ Pre-Meeting Setup (5 minutes)

### Test Run (IMPORTANT!)

```powershell
# Do a test run now
python quick_arxiv_demo.py

# When it asks about refinement, just accept defaults
# When it asks about download, type 'n' to skip (save time)

# Then clean up for fresh demo
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force arxiv_demo
```

### Have Ready

1. ‚úÖ Terminal open to your project directory
2. ‚úÖ `quick_arxiv_demo.py` tested and working
3. ‚úÖ `MEETING_DEMO_GUIDE.md` open for reference
4. ‚úÖ Optional: `paper_access_links.csv` already generated

## üìä Answers to Likely Questions

### Q: "Why did PubMed downloads fail?"

> "PubMed is a metadata database - it provides information *about* papers but doesn't host the PDFs. The papers are published in journals like 'Journal of Affective Disorders' which require subscriptions. We can access them through institutional library or by using open-access alternatives."

### Q: "Why are the DOIs missing?"

> "Findpapers relies on what the database API returns. PubMed's API sometimes doesn't include DOI fields, especially for very recent papers or those in 'ahead of print' status. We can find DOIs manually using Google Scholar or the journal website."

### Q: "How would you handle this in a real systematic review?"

> "Three-pronged approach:
> 1. **Discovery:** Search multiple databases (PubMed, arXiv, IEEE, Scopus)
> 2. **Open access:** Download what's freely available (arXiv, bioRxiv, PMC)
> 3. **Institutional access:** Use university library for paywalled papers
> 
> The automation handles the discovery and organization - the tool finds relevant papers 10x faster than manual searching. Accessing full-text still requires institutional resources for paywalled journals."

### Q: "What databases work best for downloads?"

> "Best for automatic downloads:
> - ‚úÖ arXiv (physics, CS, ML, AI)
> - ‚úÖ bioRxiv (biology preprints)
> - ‚úÖ medRxiv (medical preprints)
> - ‚úÖ PMC (PubMed Central free full-text)
> 
> Need institutional access:
> - ‚ö†Ô∏è PubMed (journal articles)
> - ‚ö†Ô∏è IEEE (engineering papers)
> - ‚ö†Ô∏è Scopus (multidisciplinary)
> - ‚ö†Ô∏è ACM (computer science)"

### Q: "Can you show the actual PDFs?"

If you ran arXiv demo with downloads:
```powershell
# Show the downloaded PDFs
explorer arxiv_demo\papers
```

If not:
> "The arXiv demo will download them - each paper gets saved as PDF in the papers folder. For the PubMed papers, I can show how to access them via DOI through the institutional library."

## üé¨ Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "I'm going to demonstrate Findpapers, a tool for automating systematic literature searches. It searches multiple academic databases, helps organize results, and attempts to download full-text PDFs."

### The Demo (5-8 minutes)

**Run the arXiv demo:**
```powershell
python quick_arxiv_demo.py
```

**While it runs, explain each step:**

1. **Search phase:**
   > "We're searching arXiv for papers on AI and mental health from 2022-2024. The query uses Boolean operators similar to traditional database searches."

2. **Refine phase** (Interactive - be ready!)
   > "Now we categorize papers. This helps organize the literature by methodology, data type, and research focus. For demo purposes, I'll mark a few as relevant."
   
   **Actions:** Press 'y' for 2-3 papers, 'n' for the rest, then 'done'

3. **Download phase:**
   > "arXiv provides direct PDF access for all papers. This is why it's valuable for AI/ML systematic reviews - no paywalls."
   
   **Actions:** Type 'y' to proceed with download

4. **BibTeX phase:**
   > "Finally, it generates a BibTeX file with complete citations. This can be imported into any reference manager like Zotero or Mendeley."

### Conclusion (1 minute)

> "This automated workflow drastically reduces the time needed for literature discovery. What might take hours manually‚Äîsearching multiple databases, organizing results, generating citations‚Äîis done in minutes.
>
> The main limitation is accessing paywalled content, which still requires institutional subscriptions. But for open-access sources like arXiv, it's a complete end-to-end solution."

### If Asked About PubMed Failures

> "I actually encountered this limitation earlier. PubMed searches work great for finding papers, but downloads fail because PubMed doesn't host PDFs. I created helper scripts to generate access links via Google Scholar and institutional libraries. Would you like to see that workflow as well?"

- **Search:** 10-20 seconds (depending on network)
- **Refine:** 60-90 seconds (interactive selection)
- **Download:** 20-40 seconds (depends on PDF sizes)
- **BibTeX:** 5 seconds
- **Show results:** 30 seconds (open PDF folder, show BibTeX file)
- **Buffer:** 2-3 minutes for explanations and questions

**Total:** 6-10 minutes including explanations

2. ‚úÖ Understanding of real-world limitations
3. ‚úÖ Created workarounds for PubMed access
4. ‚úÖ Comprehensive tutorial book for others to learn
5. ‚úÖ Professional presentation of both successes and challenges

### Final check:

```powershell
# Verify everything is ready
ls quick_arxiv_demo.py

**Good luck! You've got this! üöÄ**

Remember: The fact that you identified the download limitation and created solutions shows problem-solving skills. That's MORE impressive than a demo that just works without challenges!
