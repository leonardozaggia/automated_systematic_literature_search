Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, along with its multi-level feature indices, has provided a fresh perspective and valuable insight into the study of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease. It has been revealed that Parkinson's disease is accompanied by widespread irregularities in inherent brain network activity. However, the effective integration of the multi-level indices of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging into clinical settings for the diagnosis of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease remains a challenge. Although previous studies have demonstrated that radiomics can extract optimal features as biomarkers to identify or predict diseases, a knowledge gap still exists in the field of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the ability of radiomics features based on multi-level indices of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, along with clinical features, to distinguish between Parkinson's disease patients with and without freezing of gait. We recruited 28 patients with Parkinson's disease who had freezing of gait (15 men and 13 women, average age 63 years) and 30 patients with Parkinson's disease who had no freezing of gait (16 men and 14 women, average age 64 years). Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained using a 3.0T scanner to extract the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, mean regional homogeneity, and degree centrality. Neurological and clinical characteristics were also evaluated. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm to extract features and established feedforward neural network models based solely on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging indicators. We then performed predictive analysis of three distinct groups based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging indicators indicators combined with clinical features. Subsequently, we conducted 100 additional five-fold cross-validations to determine the most effective model for each classification task and evaluated the performance of the model using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that when differentiating patients with Parkinson's disease who had freezing of gait from those who did not have freezing of gait, or from healthy controls, the models using only the mean regional homogeneity values achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.750 (with an accuracy of 70.9%) and 0.759 (with an accuracy of 65.3%), respectively. When classifying patients with Parkinson's disease who had freezing of gait from those who had no freezing of gait, the model using the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation values combined with two clinical features achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.847 (with an accuracy of 74.3%). The most significant features for patients with Parkinson's disease who had freezing of gait were amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation alterations in the left parahippocampal gyrus and two clinical characteristics: Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Hamilton Depression Scale scores. Our findings suggest that radiomics features derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging indices and clinical information can serve as valuable indices for the identification of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.},

    abstract = {INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND Our study aims to develop an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) model for detecting depressive symptoms using actigraphy, integrating statistically significant features into machine learning models to enhance accuracy and explainability.
METHODS METHODS We analyzed actigraphy data from 3304 participants over a one-week period, classifying them into a depressive symptom group and a non-depressive symptom group. Six machine learning models, including CatBoost (CB) and XGBoost (XGB), were trained using absolute activity indicators based on three-hour intervals, relative activity indicators (nonparametric, Cosine analysis), and daytime light intensity exposure duration. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based explainability analysis was applied, and models were stratified by and gender.
RESULTS RESULTS CB and XGB demonstrated the highest classification performance in predicting mild and moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, respectively, with AUROC values of 0.679 and 0.715 across 10 random-seed models evaluated on a fixed test set. SHAP-based explainability analysis revealed that low step counts contributed to the prediction of depressive symptoms, high average activity during the least active 5-hour period of the day (L5) was associated with depressive symptoms, and we found that the onset of L5 was mainly distributed in the dawn hours. Importantly, model performance differed across demographic groups, with the highest predictive accuracy achieved in older men (AUROC = 0.756 and 0.833, respectively) for all depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the potential of actigraphy-derived step count data in AI-driven classification of depressive symptoms. Both absolute step count and temporal patterns contribute to classification, emphasizing the need for time-sensitive, explainable AI approaches for personalized mental health screening.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND BACKGROUND In the context of population aging, depression is becoming a problem that prevents middle-aged and older adults from achieving healthy aging. The impact of individual and environmental factors, on depressive symptoms has not been sufficiently examined in prior research. To identify the key impact factors of depression and explore their associations, this study developed an interpretable machine learning model based on the social ecosystems theory that encompassed multidimensional predictors.
METHODS METHODS This study analyzed the data of 4634 adults aged above 40 years from the Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents. We included 32 factors at the individual, family, and social levels that may influence depression, and compared the performance of five models. An optimal model was identified and employed to detect the factors associated with depression and the direction of their associations.
RESULTS RESULTS The categorical boosting (CatBoost) model outperformed all other models. The top four features with the greatest impact were unhealthy eating behavior, family health, health literacy, and neuroticism trait, with SHAP values of 0.60, 0.53, 0.23, and 0.20, respectively. Unhealthy eating behaviors and higher neuroticism were positively associated with the likelihood of depression, while better family health was negatively associated. In addition, the association between health literacy and depression followed an inverted U-shaped curve.
CONCLUSIONS CONCLUSIONS It is recommended to apply the CatBoost machine learning model for screening depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults. Multifaceted factors at the individual and environmental levels are suggested to be included when exploring the likelihood of depression.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND BACKGROUND Depressive disorder is a common condition; its standard diagnostic process remains time-consuming due to reliance on mental examinations. This study aimed to validate a novel, non-contact screening tool based on Vibraimage technology and machine learning for rapidly detecting depressive disorder in psychiatric outpatients.
METHODS METHODS In this study, psychiatric outpatients were recruited, underwent a 30-second video capture, which was analyzed using the Mental Health Assessment System. This system quantifies head-neck micro-movements and provides a preliminary depression diagnosis via a machine learning algorithm. The psychiatrists, blinded to the system-generated diagnosis, established the clinical diagnosis of depressive disorder. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
RESULTS RESULTS Of 1062 patients screened, 601 were enrolled and completed both the video capture and clinical evaluation. Among these, 483 (80.4 %) were clinically diagnosed with depressive disorder. The system achieved a sensitivity of 99.8 % and a specificity of 78.8 %, with positive and negative predictive values of 95.1 % and 98.9 %, respectively, and an overall accuracy of 95.7 %. The AUC was 89.3 % (95 % CI: 85.6-93.0 %). Calibration was excellent (Spiegelhalter Z test, P = 1.000; Brier score = 0.04), and decision curve analysis indicated a net clinical benefit.
CONCLUSION CONCLUSIONS The Vibraimage-based Mental Health Assessment System demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy for detecting depressive disorder in psychiatric outpatients, offering a rapid, non-invasive screening alternative. Further multicenter studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore its clinical utility and evaluate the generalizability of these findings to other population.
TRIAL REGISTRATION BACKGROUND This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06793176) on January 20, 2025, prior to participant recruitment.},

    author = {Khushi Malani and Rosa Alati and Steve Kisely and Kim Betts},
    journal = {Journal of affective disorders},
    year = {2025},
    abstract = {BACKGROUND BACKGROUND We utilised novel prenatal depression screening data in a population sample to develop a machine learning-based prediction model for postpartum psychiatric admissions.
METHODS METHODS We used health administrative data from Queensland, Australia, containing 945 clinical and demographic variables for 205,495 pregnancies between July 2015 and January 2021. Two machine learning algorithms, gradient-boosted trees and elastic net regularisation, were compared to predict postpartum psychiatric admissions occurring within 12 months of neonatal discharge.
RESULTS RESULTS Gradient-boosted trees outperformed elastic net regularisation, achieving good discrimination in the test set [AUC = 0.79, 95 % CI = (0.76, 0.82)]. As expected, the inclusion of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ascertained during pregnancy improved the model's predictive performance. Antenatal mental health diagnoses, being a single mother and smoking during pregnancy were also found to be strong risk factors.
LIMITATIONS CONCLUSIONS This study contained no information on community or outpatient mental health visits and excluded private obstetrics patients.
CONCLUSION CONCLUSIONS Our prediction model may enable early identification and timely intervention for at-risk women during pregnancy which, in turn, may reduce the severity of postpartum mental health problems or the need for postpartum psychiatric admissions.},
